    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello, My name is Bryce Ilano and I am currently a freshman at Lewis University majoring in Computer Science. I am the oldest of two boys and I still live with my mom and dad.</p>
    <h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course </h2>
    <ul class="b">
        <li>AI</li>
        <li>Objects and Drawing</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</h2>
    <p>Things that I like to do in my free time are binging Netflix and playing Video Games. Playing Video Games has more become a habit because I've been playing since a young age. I also enjoy binging Netflix because I really enjoy consuming fiction and being immersed in it.</p>
    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>A fun fact about myself is that I really enjoy trivia and learning about history or random facts and looking deeper into it.</p>
